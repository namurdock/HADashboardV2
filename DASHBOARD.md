# Description

HADashboard is a dashboard for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) that is intended to be wall mounted, and is optimized for distance viewing.

# Installation and Configuration

HADashboard is dependent upon AppDaemon. As a first step please refer to the [AppDaemon Documentation](README.md).

When you have AppDaemon installed and running, configuration of the Dashboard is pretty simple. You just need to add a directive to the config file - `dash_url`.

- `dash_url` - the url you want the dashboard service to listen on

For instance:

```ini
dash_url = http://192.168.1.20:5050
```

Note that at this time only http is supported.

By default, dashboards are searched for under the config directory in a sub directory called `dashboards`. Optionally, you can place your dashboards in a directory other than under the config directory using the `dash_dir` directive.

e.g.:

```ini
dash_dir = /etc/appdaemon/dashboards
```

When you have added those lines, restart AppDaemon and you will be ready to go. If you navigate to the top level, e.g. ```http://192.168.1.20:5050``` in the case above, you will see a welcome page with a list of configured dashboards. If you haven't yet configured any the list will be empty.

When you have created a dashboard you can navigate to it by going to ```http://192.168.1.20:5050/<Dashboard Name>```

If you are using AppDaemon just for the dasboard and not the Apps, you can disable the app engine with the following directive:

```ini
disable_apps = 1
```

This will free up some CPU and memory.

HADashboard pre-compiles all of the user created Dashboard for efficiency. It will detect when changes have been made to widgets, styles or dahsboards and automatically recompile. This is usually desirable as compilation can take several seconds on slower hardware for a fully loaded dashboard, however to force a recompilation every time,  use the following directive:

```ini
dash_force_compile = 1
```

This will force dashboard recompilation whenever the dashboard is loaded. You can also force a recompilation by adding the parameter `recompile=1` to the dashboard URL.

# Dashboard Configuration

Dashboard configuration is simple yet very powerful. Dashboards can be created in single files or made modular for reuse of blocks of widgets. Dashboards are configured using YAML.

We will start with a simple single file configuration. Create a file with a `.dash` extension in the `dashboards` directory, and pull it up in your favorite editor.

## Main Settings

A top level dashboard will usually have one of a number of initial directives to configure aspects of the dashboard, although they are all optional. An example is as follows:

```yaml
#
# Main arguments, all optional
#
title: Main Panel
widget_dimensions: [120, 120]
widget_margins: [5, 5]
columns: 8
```

These are all fairly self explanatory:

- `title` - the name that will end up in the title of the web page, defaults to "HADashboard".
- `widget_dimensions` - the unit height and width of the individual widgets in pixels. Note tha the absolute size is not too important as on tablets at least the browser will scale the page to fit. What is more important is the aspect ratio of the widgets as this will affect whether or not the dashboard completely fills the tablets screen. The default is [120, 120] (width, height). This works well for a regular iPad. 
- `widget_margins` - the size of blank space between widgets.
- `columns` - the number of columns the dasboard will have.

The very simplest dashboard needs a layout so it can understand where to place the widgets. We use a `layout` directive to tell HADasboard how to place them. Here is an example:

```yaml

layout:
    - light.hall, light.living_room, input_boolean.heating
    - media_player(2x1), sensor.temperature
```

As you can see, here we are refering directly to native Home Assistant entities. From this, HADashboard is able to figure out the right widget type and grab it's friendly name and add it to the dasboard. For the `clock` and `weather` widgets there is no associated entity id so just your `clock.clock` or `weather.weather`.

The layout command is intended to be visual in how you lay out the widgets. Each layout entry represents a row on the dashboard, each comma separated widget represents a cell on that row.

Widgets can also have a size associated with them - that is the `(2x1)` directive appended to the name. This is simply the width of the widget in columns and the height of the widget in rows. For instance, `(2x1)` would refer to a widget 2 cells wide and 1 cell high. If you leave of the sizing information, the widget will default to (1x1). HADasboard will do it's best to calculate the right layout from what you give it but expect strange behavior if you add too many widgets on a line.

For a better visual cue you can lay the widgets out with appropriate spacing to see what the grid will look like more intuitively:

```yaml
 layout:
    - light.hall,       light.living_room, input_boolean.heating
    - media_player(2x1),                   sensor.temperature
```

... and so on.

Make sure that the number of widths specified adds up to the total number of columns, and don't forget to take into account widgets that are more than one row high (e.g. the weather widget here).

If you want a blank space you can use the special widget name `spacer`. To leave a whole row empty, just leave an entry for it with no text. For instance:

```yaml
    - light.hall, light.living_room, input_boolean.heating
    -
    - media_player(2x1), sensor.temperature
```

The above would leave the 2nd row empty.

And that is all there to it, for a simple one file dashboard.


## Detailed Widget Definition

The approach above is ok for simple widgets like lights, but HADashboard has a huge range of customization options. To access these, you need to formally define the widget along with its associated parameters.

To define a widget simply add lines elsewhere in the file. Give it a name , a widget type and a number of optional parameters like this:

```yaml
weather_widget:
    widget_type: weather
    units: "&deg;F"
```

Here we have defined a widget of type "weather", and given it an optional parameter to tell it what units to use for temperature. Each widget type will have different required parameters, refer to the documentation below for a complete list for each type. All widgets support ways to customize colors and text sizes as well as attibutes they need to understand how to link the widget to Home Assistant, such as entity_ids.

Lets look at a couple more examples of widget definitions:

```yaml
clock:
    widget_type: clock

weather:
    widget_type: weather
    units: "&deg;F"
    
side_temperature:
    widget_type: sensor
    title: Temperature
    units: "&deg;F"
    precision: 0
    entity: sensor.side_temp_corrected

side_humidity:
    widget_type: sensor
    title: Humidity
    units: "%"
    precision: 0
    entity: sensor.side_humidity_corrected

andrew_presence:
    widget_type: device_tracker
    title: Andrew
    device: andrews_iphone

wendy_presence:
    widget_type: device_tracker
    title: Wendy
    device: wendys_iphone

mode:
    widget_type: text_sensor
    title: House Mode
    entity: input_select.house_mode

light_level:
    widget_type: sensor
    title: Light Level
    units: "lux"
    precision: 0
    shorten: 1
    entity: sensor.side_multisensor_luminance_25_3
        
porch_motion:
    widget_type: binary_sensor
    title: Porch
    entity: binary_sensor.porch_multisensor_sensor_27_0

garage:
    widget_type: switch
    title: Garage
    entity: switch.garage_door
    icon_on: fa-car
    icon_off: fa-car
    warn: 1

```

Now, instead of an entity id we refer to the name of the widgets we just defined:

```yaml

layout:
    - clock(2x1), weather(2x2), side_temperature(1x1), side_humidity(1x1), andrew_presence(1x1), wendy_presence(1x1)
    - mode(2x1), light_level(2x1), porch_motion(1x1), garage(1x1)
```

It is also possible to add a widget from a standalone file. The file will contain a single widget definition. To create a clock widget this way we would make a file called `clock.yaml` and place it in the dashboard directory along with the dashboard. The contents would look something like this:

```yaml
widget_type: clock
background_color: red
```

Note that the indentation level starts at 0. To include this file, just reference a widget called `clock` in the layout, and HADashboard will automatically load the widget.

A file will override a native entity, so you can create your dashboard just using entities, but if you want to customize a specific entity, you can just create a file named `<entity_name>.yaml` and put the settings in there. You can also override entity names by specifying a widget of that name in the same or any other file, which will take priority over a standalone yaml file.

And that is all there to it, for a simple one file dashboard.

# Advanced Dashboard Definition

When you get to the point where you have multiple dashboards, you may want to take a more modular approach, as you will find that in many cases you want to reuse parts of other dashboards. For instance, I have a common header for mine consisting of a row or two of widgets I want to see on every dashboard. I also have a footer of controls to switch between dashboards that I want on each dashboard as well.

To facilitate this, it is possible to include additional files, inline to build up dashboards in a more modular fashion. These additional files end in `.yaml` to distinguish them from top level dashboards. They can contain additional widget definitions and also optionally their own layouts.

The sub files are included in the layout using a variation of the layout directive:

```yaml
layout:
    - include: top_panel
```

This will look for a file called `top_panel.yaml` in the dashboards directory, then include it. There are a couple of different ways this can be used.

- If the yaml file includes it's own layouts directive, the widgets from that file will be placed as a block, in the way described by its layout, making it reusable. You can change the order of the blocks inclusion by moving where in the original layout directive you include them.
- If the yaml file just includes widget definitions, it is possible to perform the layout in the higher level dash if you prefer so you still get an overall view of the dashboard. This approach has the benefit that you can be completely flexible in the layout wheras the first method defines fixed layouts for the included blocks.

I prefer the completely modular approach - here is an example of a full top level dashboard created in that way:

```yaml
title: Main Panel
widget_dimensions: [120, 120]
widget_margins: [5, 5]
columns: 8

layout:
    - include: top_panel
    - include: main_middle_panel
    - include: mode_panel
    - include: bottom_panel
```

As you can see, it includes four modular sub-dashes. Since these pieces all have their own layout information there is no need for additional layout in the top level file. Here is an example of one of the self contained sub modules (mode_panel.yaml):

```yaml
clock:
    widget_type: clock

weather:
    widget_type: weather
    units: "&deg;F"

side_temperature:
    widget_type: sensor
    title: Temperature
    units: "&deg;F"
    precision: 0
    entity: sensor.side_temp_corrected

side_humidity:
    widget_type: sensor
    title: Humidity
    units: "%"
    precision: 0
    entity: sensor.side_humidity_corrected

andrew_presence:
    widget_type: device_tracker
    title: Andrew
    device: andrews_iphone

wendy_presence:
    widget_type: device_tracker
    title: Wendy
    device: dedb5e711a24415baaae5cf8e880d852

mode:
    widget_type: text_sensor
    title: House Mode
    entity: input_select.house_mode

light_level:
    widget_type: sensor
    title: Light Level
    units: "lux"
    precision: 0
    shorten: 1
    entity: sensor.side_multisensor_luminance_25_3
        
porch_motion:
    widget_type: binary_sensor
    title: Porch
    entity: binary_sensor.porch_multisensor_sensor_27_0

garage:
    widget_type: switch
    title: Garage
    entity: switch.garage_door
    icon_on: fa-car
    icon_off: fa-car
    warn: 1

layout:
    - clock(2x1), weather(2x2), side_temperature, side_humidity, andrew_presence, wendy_presence
    - mode(2x1), light_level(2x1), porch_motion, garage

```

Now if we take a look at that exact same layout, but assume that just the widget definitions are in the sub-blocks, we would end up with something like this - note that we must explicitly lay out each widget we have included in the other files:

```yaml
title: Main Panel
widget_dimensions: [120, 120]
widget_margins: [5, 5]
columns: 8

layout:
    - include: top_panel
    - include: main_middle_panel
    - include: mode_panel
    - include: bottom_panel
    - clock(2x1), weather(2x2), side_temperature, side_humidity, andrew_presence, wendy_presence
    - mode(2x1), light_level(2x1), porch_motion, garage
    - wlamp_scene, don_scene, doff_scene, dbright_scene, upstairs_thermometer, downstairs_thermometer, basement_thermometer, thermostat_setpoint  
    - obright_scene, ooff_scene, pon_scene, poff_scene, night_motion, guest_mode, cooling, heat
    - morning(2x1), day(2x1), evening(2x1), night(2x1)
    - load_main_panel, load_upstairs_panel, load_upstairs, load_downstairs, load_outside, load_doors, load_controls, reload  
```

In this case, the actual layout including a widget must be after the include as you might expect.

A few caveats for loaded sub files:

- Sub files can include other subfiles to a maximum depth of 10 - please avoid circular references!
- When layout information is included in a sub file, the subfile must comprise 1 or more complete dashboard rows - partial rows or blocks are not supported.

# Widget Customization

Widgets allow customization using arbitary CSS styles for the individual elements that make up the widget. Every widget has a ``widget_style` argument to apply styles to the whole widget, as well as one or more additional style arguments that differ for each widget. To customize a widget background for instance:

```yaml
clock:
  widget_type: clock
  widget_style: "background: white;"
```
As is usual with CSS you can feed it multiple parameters at once, e.g.:

```yaml
clock:
  widget_type: clock
  widget_style: "background: white; font-size: 150%;"
```

You can use any valid CSS style here although you should probably steer away from some of the formatting types as they may interact badly with HADasboards formatting. Also, dpeneding upon the options used in specific skins, you may get unexpected results as the widget definition of a style will completely override the skin's own definition. This is fine if the skin uses just colors for instance, but if it uses other effects you will need to suplicate them in your widget definition or they will be removed. 

In the case of the clock widget, it also supports `date_style` and `time_style` to modify those elements accordingly:

```yaml
clock:
  widget_type: clock
  widget_style: "background: white"
  date_style: "color: black"
  time_style: "color: green"
```
Since `date_style` and `time_style` are applied to more specific elements, they will override `widget_style`. Also note that some widget styles may be specified in the widget's CSS, in which case that style will override `widget_style` but not the more specific styles.

# Widget Reference

Here is the current list of widgets and their description and supported parameters:

## clock

A simple 12 hour clock with the date. Not currently very customizable but it will be improved upon.

### Mandatory arguments: 

None

# Skins

HADashboard fully supports skinning and ships with a number of skins. To access a specific skin, append the parameter `skin=<skin name>` to the dashboard URL. Skin names are sticky if you use the Navigate widet to switch between dashboards and will stay in force until another skin or no skin is specified.

HADasboard currently has the following skins available:

- default - the classic HADashboard skin, very simple
- obsidian, contributed by `@rpitera`
- zen, contributed by `@rpitera`
- simplyred, contributed by `@rpitera`
- glassic, contributed by `@rpitera`


# Skin development

HADashboard fully supports customization through skinning. It ships with a number of skins courtesy of @rpitera, and we encourage users to create new skins and contribute them back to the project.

To create a custom skin you will need to know a little bit of CSS. Start off by creating a directory called `custom_css` in the configuration directory, at the same level as your dashboards directory. Next, create a subdirectory in `custom_css` named for your skin.

The skin itself consists of 2 separate files:

- `dashboard.css` - This is the base dashboard CSS that sets widget styles, background look and feel etc.
- `variables.yaml` - This is a list of variables that describe how different elements of the widgets will look. Using the correct variables you can skin pretty much every element of every widget type.

Dashboard.css is a regular css file, and knowledge of CSS is required to make changes to it.

Variables.yaml is really a set of overrise styles, so you can use fragments of CSS here, basically anything that you could normally put in an HTML `style` tag. Variables .yaml also supports variable expansion to make structuring the file easier. Anything that starts with a `$` is treated as a variable that refers back to one of the other yaml fields in the file. 

Here is an example of a piece of a variables.yaml file:

```yaml
#
# Styles
#

white: "#fff"
red: "#ff0055"
green: "#aaff00"
blue: "#00aaff"
purple: "#aa00ff"
yellow: "#ffff00"
orange: "#ffaa00"

gray_dark: "#444"
gray_medium: "#666"
gray_light: "#888"

#Page and widget defaults
background_style: ""
text_style: ""

#These are used for icons and indicators
style_inactive: "color: $gray_light"
style_active: "color: gold"
style_active_warn: "color: gold"
style_info: "color: gold; font-weight: 500; font-size: 250%"
style_title: "color: gold; font-weight: 900"
style_title2: "color: $white"
```

Here we are setting up some general variables that we can reuse for styling the actual widgets.

Below, we are setting styles for a specific widget, the light widget. All entries are required but can be left blank by using double quotes.

```yaml
light_icon_on: fa-circle
light_icon_off: fa-circle-thin
light_icon_up: fa-plus
light_icon_down: fa-minus
light_title_style: $style_title
light_title2_style: $style_title2
light_icon_style_active: $style_active
light_icon_style_inactive: $style_inactive
light_state_text_style: $white
light_level_style: "color: $gray_light"
light_level_up_style: "color: $gray_light"
light_level_down_style: "color: $gray_light"
light_widget_style: ""
```

Images can be included - create a sub directory in your skin directory, call it `img` or whatever you like, then refer to it in the css as:

`/custom_css/<skin name>/<image directory>/<image filename>`

One final feature is the ability to include additional files in the header and body of the page if required. This can be useful to allow additional CSS from 3rd parties or include JavaScript.

Custom head includes - should be a YAML List inside `variables.yaml`, e.g.:

```yaml
head_includes:
  - some include
  - some other include
```
Text will be included verbatim in the head section of the doc, use for styles, javascript or 3rd party css etc. etc. It is your responsibility to ensure the HTML is correct

Similarly for body includes:

```yaml
body_includes:
  - some include
  - some other include
```

To learn more about complete styles, take a look at the supplied styles to see how they are put together. Start off with the `dashboard.css` and `variables.yaml` from an exisitng file and edit to suit your needs.

# Widget Development

Widget Development is currently not supported in the Beta version of HADashboard. When the full release is available, there will be a fully developed Widget API and a description of how to add new widgets and contribute them back to the community. For nom although the widgets supplied are fully functional they are likely to change significantly in the future, and are not currently a good basis for widget development.
